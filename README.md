# Sentinel: Login with Urbit (user app)

This is the app that users install, it talks to [Beacon](https://github.com/tinnus-napbus/beacon) on the server.

The folders are:

- `/bare-desk`: just the new files for this desk, no dependencies.
- `/full-desk`: both new files and dependencies (the complete desk). Note files are symlinked so you'll need to copy them with `cp -rL` or equivalent.
- `ui`: React front-end.
